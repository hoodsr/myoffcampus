List of things left to do:

Fix login page
	No scrolling, no white space when keyboard shows up  (enhancement) 
	An error message when user type wrong password or name
Profile Image
	DONE temporary fix: add a person icon onto that circle box 
	// I was thinking a generic computer person icon because a female user might 
	// not want a guy image, unless he’s handsome… (enhancement) 
	permenant fix: let user take profile image from camera or gallery
LANDLORD
	I am thinking on the detail page: rating, name, contact info, reviews, and a 	a button for user to add a property. After adding, will create create a link
	to that prop detail page. 
Property
	Put a list of landlord onto the detail page somewhere (enhancement)

Give every property an image to be displayed in the feed format (enhancement)
  If no reviews, overall rating should be '-'. Should be black  // right now, it’s 0
  Change the css for ratings with two digits on location detail page. 
Reviews
  Add new categories (enhancement)
  Make it beautiful (enhancement) 
Add spinners (required b/c parse is so slow)and error messages to pages (enhancement)

Completed things: 
  SPINNERS DONE SO FAR: login, register, location feed (NEED TO ADD THEM BACK)
  Calculate average of reviews. Just sum of ratings/reviews.length
  Able to save a landlord into a database
